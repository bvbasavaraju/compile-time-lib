== List

It is a container which holds the types. It is an heterogenous container. 

To use make sure to add `#include <container/list.hpp>` in source file. 

There are 3 variants of list

* `clt::list<>` => non-instantiable list
* `ctl::ilist<>` => instantiable list
* `ctl::clist<>` => instantiable and callable list. It has many operator over-loadings which can be called at runtime. Example for the same can be found in `src/main.cpp` file

Many algorithms can be applied on the list type created. Algorithms from MP11 can also be used with the list type.
